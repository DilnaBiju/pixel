        MEET DESTINY
    </h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>
            Destiny, a gentle-natured, loving 10-year-old Beagle, captured the hearts of Americans and clinched the title of the 2024 America's Favorite Pet. Her human mom, Rebeca Mata, shared their inspiring journey in an exclusive interview with Colossal.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a young age, Destiny was found pregnant, sick, and abandoned. But this is a story of resilience and perseverance, and she survived against all odds. Now, Destiny embodies gentleness, trust, and love, teaching children valuable lessons in strength and moving forward. As a therapy dog at Mata Counseling Services in Flower Mound, Texas, Destiny has become a cherished friend to many children and adults. With her gentle demeanor and intuitive understanding of emotional needs, she creates a safe and comforting environment for individuals to navigate trauma.

        <p>
            "Her soul knew that she had to live for bigger and better things. Her 'Destiny' was to be a hero for children and be a companion for me. I rescued her when I needed her the most," said Rebeca, a licensed professional counselor and founder of Mata Counseling Services. Drawing from her own experiences as a survivor, Rebeca recognizes the healing power of canine companionship.

            Destiny's loving demeanor extends beyond her therapeutic work. In Rebeca's household, she shares her home with several senior rescue pets, including Derek (Maltese), Danny (Chinchilla), Dash (the Russian tortoise), and the late Diego (Maltese) and Dylan (Chinchilla). Destiny brings joy, energy, and laughter into their lives, serving as a guiding light during moments of grief and loss.

            In sharing Destiny's story, Rebeca hopes to inspire others to explore the transformative potential of Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT). This service harnesses the powerful bond between humans and animals, particularly dogs, to aid in the treatment process. This intervention has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression while enhancing self-esteem, social skills, and empathy.

            In reflection on the AFP competition, Rebeca said, "My favorite part of this competition was watching 'Team Destiny' grow. I am enormously humbled by all of the support that Destiny received. She was not a famous social media dog and did not have hundreds of thousands of followers, yet sooooo many people rallied for her, supported her, believed in her, and took her to the top! My heart is so happy."
