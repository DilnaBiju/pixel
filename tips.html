   <h1>Confused about how to help your pet?</h1>
   <p style="text-align: center;">As a pet parent you want to do everything you can to care for your pet; this involves regular, everyday activities to ensure they stay happy and healthy. Practice these ten responsible pet care tips year after year for a lifetime of happy and healthy cats and dogs.</p>

       <div class="tip-box">
           <h2>1. Veterinarian Visits</h2>
           <p>Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. Given their shorter-than-human lifespan, your dog or cat should be getting a checkup at least once or twice a year. Depending on your pet's vaccination schedule, they may go more frequently when they're young, but establishing and maintaining good pet health means keeping up with vet visits as they age.</p>

       <div class="tip-box">
           <h2>2. Vaccinations</h2>
           <p>Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care. Soon after welcoming your new pet into your home, schedule an immunization appointment. Vaccinations help prevent diseases such as rabies, Lyme disease, and distemper for dogs, and feline herpes virus and rabies for cats.</p>

       <div class="tip-box">
           <h2>3. Proper Identification</h2>
           <p>If the unthinkable happens and your little guy or gal gets lost — youngsters in particular are prone to dashing out the door — having proper identification is key to a happy ending. Start with a safe collar, and a tag that contains all of your contact information. Microchipping is also advisable as it ensures your pet can be identified even if their collar falls off.</p>

       <div class="tip-box">
           <h2>4. Spaying/Neutering</h2>
           <p>Sterilizing your pet prevents a host of health problems, including complicated pregnancies, and reduces the number of homeless animals. Spaying and neutering reduce the risk of various cancers and unwanted behaviors such as aggression and roaming in dogs.</p>
